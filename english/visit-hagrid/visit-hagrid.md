Hermione, Harry, and Ron saunter down to Hagrid's hut.
Before they even knock they are greeted by Fang's loud barking, prompting Hagrid to come to the door.

Snape wanders in looking really drunk and smelling of whiskey.

He trips over Fang. The dog looks up and lets out a low grumble then settles again by the side 
of the door.
